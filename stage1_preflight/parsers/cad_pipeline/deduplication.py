"""
Post-extraction deduplication.

DXF files (especially Revit exports) often represent the same structural
element as both an LWPOLYLINE outline and a HATCH fill on the same layer.
The extraction pipeline treats each as a separate element, producing
duplicates that would create overlapping objects in ETABS.

This module merges elements whose centroids coincide (within tolerance)
and whose dimensions match, keeping only one representative per group.
